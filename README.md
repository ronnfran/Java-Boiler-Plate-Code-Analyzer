# Java-Boiler-Plate-Code-Analyzer

Program that analyzes the amount of boilerplate in its own sources code by counting the number of keywords (`public`, `static`, `void`, `main`, ...) and symbols (`(`, `{`, `;`, ...) used.

This program is written very poorly intensionally to illustrate that through refactoring and the use of functional programming (which java does have a little bit of) the readability and maintainability of the code can be greatly improved.

## Similar Projects

Similar programs are being written in F#, go, rust and python to explore how 'newer' programming languages tend to have much less boilerplate code and whether this makes them more readable and maintainable.
